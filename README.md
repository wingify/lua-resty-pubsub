## Description

This Lua library is a Pubsub client driver for the ngx_lua nginx module: http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule

This Lua library takes advantage of ngx_lua's cosocket API, which ensures 100% nonblocking behavior. This library pushes messages (with attributes) to Google Cloud pubsub using nginx timers and http requests.

Note that at least [ngx_lua 0.9.3](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/tags) or [ngx_openresty 1.4.3.7](http://openresty.org/#Download) is required, and unfortunately only LuaJIT supported (`--with-luajit`).

## Synopsis

```lua
    lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-pubsub/lib/?.lua;;";

    server {
        location = /test {
            resolver 8.8.8.8 ipv6=off;

                -- A callback which will recieve messages if gets successfully sent
                -- Types of messages & err are a table
                local success_callback = function (topic, err, messages)
                    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "Messages: ", cjson.encode(messages), " successfully pushed to topic: ", topic)

        }
    }
```

## Configs

The `project_id` is a string name of your pub/sub project

A `pubsub_config` table needs to be specified with following options:

* `topic`

    Specifies the topic in which the data needs to be send

* `pubsub_base_domain`

    Specifies the base domain through which the http connection is made. (Optional)

* `pubsub_base_port`

    Specifies the base domain port through which the http connection is made. (Optional)

Example
```json
{
    "topic": "demo-topic",
    "pubsub_base_domain": "pubsub.googleapis.com",
    "pubsub_base_port": 443
}
```

A `producer_config` table needs to be specified which is entirely optional having default values. It's options are:

* `max_batch_size`

    Specifies the max batch size that will be pushed to pubsub. (Optional)

* `max_buffering`

    Specifies the max size of the buffer which will hold the data for a specific duration of time. (Optional)

* `timer_interval`

    Specifies the time interval (in ms) in which the stale messages in buffer are checked for publishing. (Optional)

* `last_flush_interval`

    Specifies the max interval (in ms) between the last flush time and current time. Used when packets in buffer are less than the batch size for a longer period of time. (Optional)

* `http_timeout`

    Sets the timeout (in ms) protection for subsequent operations, including the connect method. (Optional)

* `keepalive_max_idle_timeout` and `keepalive_pool_size`

    Used in httpc:set_keepalive which attempts to puts the current connection into the ngx_lua cosocket connection pool. (Optional)

Example
```json
{
    "max_batch_size" : 200,
    "max_buffering" : 5000,
    "timer_interval" : 10000,
    "last_flush_interval" : 5000,
    "http_timeout" : 6000,
    "keepalive_max_idle_timeout" : 2000,
    "keepalive_pool_size" : 50
}
```

A `oauth_config` table needs to be specified which is used for generating the oauth 2.0 verification for http request. It's options are:

* `service_account_key_path`

    Specifies the path for service account key that are used to authenticate to pub/sub project. (Mandatory)

* `oauth_base_uri`

    Specifies the base uri to which request is made to Google authorization server for a token that will be used in subsequent requests. (Optional)

* `oauth_scopes`

    Specifies a table comprising of OAuth 2.0 scopes that you might need to request to access Google APIs, depending on the level of access you need. (Optional)

Example
```json
{
    "service_account_key_path": "/etc/key.json",
    "oauth_base_uri": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token",
    "oauth_scopes": {
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/pubsub"
    }
}
```

A `success_handler` can also be provide which is optional. This is a callback function which will be provided with all the messages with their attributes which are successfully pushed to pubsub.

A `error_handler` can also be provide which is optional. This is a callback function which will be executed when a batch fails.

A `oauth_setter` can also be provide which is also optional. This is a callback which sets the generated oauth token according to user implementing it. For example, one might need to store oauth token in shared dictionary(as shown in this example) or maybe want to store it in redis etc. If not provided oauth will be set according to the library provided oauth setter.

A `oauth_getter` can also be provide which is also optional (Mandatory if oauth_setter is provided). This is a callback which returns the oauth_token by fetching it from the location where the user has set in oauth_setter. (For better understanding of how this callback works, refer the above given synopsis)

## Dependencies

Lua modules required to build this library are:

* [lua-cjson](https://github.com/openresty/lua-cjson.git) library
* [lua-resty-rsa](https://github.com/spacewander/lua-resty-rsa) library
* [lua-resty-http](https://github.com/ledgetech/lua-resty-http) library

## Installation

### For Installing module

#### Method 1 - Using luarocks

For installing luarocks refer [this](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Download)

You can simply run `luarocks install lua-resty-pubsub` for installing this library

#### Method 2 - Using Makefile

You need to configure
the lua_package_path directive to add the path of your lua-resty-pubsub source
tree to ngx_lua's LUA_PATH search path, as in

```nginx
    # nginx.conf
    http {
        lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-pubsub/lib/?.lua;;";
        ...
    }
```

You also need to add google resolver so as to connect with pubsub endpoints
```nginx
    # default.conf
    server {
        location = /test {
            resolver 8.8.8.8 ipv6=off;
            ...
	    }
    }
```

Ensure that the system account running your Nginx ''worker'' proceses have
enough permission to read the `.lua` file.

Also if using OAUTH_TOKEN dictionary, add `lua_shared_dict` in nginx.conf

Finally run `make install` for installing the module

### For Running Test Cases

Run `sudo cpan Test::Nginx` for installing nginx test module

Finally run `make test` for running the test cases
